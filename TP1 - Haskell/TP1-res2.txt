3 Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
2 Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?
2 Or both .
2 Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .
1 Phoned-in business as usual .

2 Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .
3 Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .

4 The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
3 One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .
2 A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .

0 A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
1 First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
2 I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .

3 Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .
3 Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .

3 The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .
2 Punitively affirmational parable .
1 Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
3 Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .
3 Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .
3 This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .
1 But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .
3 Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
1 There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
4 A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .
2 It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
4 The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
0 It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
3 The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .
2 An often unfunny romp .
2 It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
2 Clever but not especially compelling .
1 An EXIT sign , that is .
2 It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
4 The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
1 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
3 Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .
1 It drowns in sap .
2 ` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
4 A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude .
3 `` Red Dragon '' never cuts corners .
2 modeled
1 Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .
1 Bland but harmless .
1 Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
1 A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- .
3 It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
1 No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
1 The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
3 Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .

0 I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
0 There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
1 I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
3 There 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to Lau .
1 Action - mechanical .
1 None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
0 An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
1 Wait to see it then .
0 None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .
2 -- was a fad that had long since vanished .
1 An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
1 Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
2 I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
